# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime for building the server  
- **Express.js** — web framework for handling routes and middleware  
- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database for storing user and clothing data  
- **Mongoose** — ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB  
- **Nodemon** — development tool for automatic server restarts  
- **ESLint (Airbnb config)** — for maintaining code quality and consistency  
- **RESTful API principles** — for structured and scalable endpoints  
- **Postman** - used to manually send HTTP requests to the Express server and verify responses.
