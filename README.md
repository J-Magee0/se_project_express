# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWR (What to Wear?) Backend API serves as the server-side component of a weather-based clothing recommendation application. This project is designed to help users make informed decisions about their daily outfits based on weather conditions. The backend handles user authentication, manages clothing items, and provides secure API endpoints for the frontend application. Built with Node.js and Express.js, it implements RESTful API principles and uses MongoDB for data persistence. This application features user authentication using JSON Web Tokens(JWT), secure password hashing, and error handling. Users can create their own accounts, manage clothing items including adding, liking, and deletion; as well as recieving personal clothing recomendations.This project demonstrates modern backend development practices, including modular architecture, middleware implementation, and secure API design.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime for building the server
- **Express.js** — web framework for handling routes and middleware
- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database for storing user and clothing data
- **Mongoose** — ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **Nodemon** — development tool for automatic server restarts
- **ESLint (Airbnb config)** — for maintaining code quality and consistency
- **RESTful API principles** — for structured and scalable endpoints
- **Postman** - used to manually send HTTP requests to the Express server and verify responses.
